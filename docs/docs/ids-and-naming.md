# VerseCraft ID & Naming Contract (LOCKED)

This document defines the **canonical, non-negotiable naming rules** for all VerseCraft stories, assets, and systems.

If something is not defined here, it does not exist.

## 1. STORY IDS (CANONICAL)

Story IDs are the primary keys used by:
- `stories.json`
- save files
- app.js runtime state
- future creator interfaces
- asset naming

### Rules
- lowercase only
- underscore-separated
- no spaces
- no hyphens
- never renamed once published

### Valid Story IDs
